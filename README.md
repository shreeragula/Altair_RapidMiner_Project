*AltairFlow*
*Project Overview*  
AltairFlow is a machine learning pipeline developed using **Altair AI Studio (RapidMiner)** for course recommendation and rating analysis. This project aims to analyze online courses, extract insights, and recommend the best options based on difficulty, ratings, and required skills.  

#Key Features 
- **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Cleaning and preparing course data (CSV).  
- **Model Training** â€“ AI model for rating predictions.  
- **Visualization** â€“ Insights on course difficulty versus ratings.  
- **Automated Workflow** â€“ End-to-end pipeline in Altair AI Studio.  

## **Project Structure**  
- `process.rmp` â€“ The Altair RapidMiner workflow.  
- `Coursera.csv` â€“ Dataset used for training and analysis.  
- `README.md` â€“ Project documentation.  

## **Usage Instructions**  
1. Open **Altair AI Studio**.  
2. Import the `process.rmp` file.  
3. Load the `Coursera.csv` dataset.  
4. Execute the pipeline and analyze the results.  

## **Tools and Technologies Used**  
- **Altair AI Studio (RapidMiner)**  
- **Python (if applicable)**  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**
